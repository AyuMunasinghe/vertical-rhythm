Vertical Rhythm
===============

LESS and CSS boilerplates for creating typographical vertical rhythm in your project. Made to be compatible with Twitter Bootstrap as LESS component, but it can also be used standalone for any project.

This is just a starting point and will need to be customized for your needs.

Contributions are requests welcome. Please be comment the code in your requests so I can easily and quickly evaluate the code. 

Thanks!
